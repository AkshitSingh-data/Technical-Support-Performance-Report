# Technical-Support-Performance-Report

I'm excited to share a Power BI project that I recently completed: Technical Support Performance Dashboard! This dashboard is designed to provide clear, actionable insights into various technical support metrics, enhancing data-driven decision-making. Below is an overview of the project: Scroll below for the dashboard

Data Preparation Steps

**Data Extraction:**

1-Extracted the dataset from Kaggle. You can find it https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suvroo/technical-support-dataset. The dataset contains data for the year 2023.

**Data Transformation:**

1-Used DAX to calculate the days between the ticket creation time and resolution time.

2-Extracted month, quarter, and weekday from the date column.

3-Created a flag column using DAX to indicate whether the day is a weekday or a weekend.

**Data Loading:**

1-Loaded the transformed data into the report view and developed the dashboard.

**Additional Features:**

1-Added filters by country, agent, and priority to enable comprehensive performance monitoring.

**Dynamic X-axis:**

1-Implemented field parameters to create a flexible X-axis, allowing clients to view ticket inflow by month, quarter, or weekday.

âœ¨ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1-Average response and resolution times compared to set thresholds.

2-Percentage of SLA-violated tickets.

3-Progress of tickets at different completion stages.

ðŸ”Ž Visual Insights

1-Monthly Ticket Trends: Displaying variations throughout the year.

2-Ticket Distribution by Rating and Priority: Assessing service quality.

3-Weekday/Weekend Analysis: Providing insights for resource allocation optimization.

**Topic Breakdown:** Highlighting common customer concerns.

ðŸ”§ Why It Matters

This dashboard is a powerful tool for support teams to stay on top of their goals, understand their performance trends, and respond proactively to service challenges.
